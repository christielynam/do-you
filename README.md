# Do You built with React Starter Kit

Do You was a 2-week self-directed project. It is a visually interactive personality assessment application built using React, React Router and Redux. The backend server was built with Express, Knex, and Postgres

Clone this repo and the [backend repo](https://github.com/christielynam/do-you-postgres)

To install the dependencies (for both):

```
npm install
```

To fire up a development server (for both):

```
npm start
```

Once the server is running, you can visit:

* `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/` to run the application.

* The backend server will be running on `http://localhost:3000`
